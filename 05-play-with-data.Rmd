Now that we have the data formatted where each row is the latest single inspection record for a restaurant, let's see what we can find out!



```{r, eval=FALSE}
#05- play-with-data
glimpse(rest_df_filtered)

#How do the inspection score vary by city?

# Average and Max Score by City
score_by_city<-rest_df_filtered %>% group_by(CITY) %>% summarize(avg_score= mean(SCORE_INSPECTION),
                                                                 max_score = max(SCORE_INSPECTION),
                                                                 n_rests = n())
                                                                 

# What is the info on the restaurant with the worst score by city?

worst_by_city<-rest_df_filtered %>% group_by(CITY) %>% top_n(1, SCORE_INSPECTION)

# What was the data on the restaurant I liked?

bizzaro_df_filtered <- rest_df_filtered %>% dplyr::filter(str_detect(NAME, 'BIZZARRO'))

```

Your turn, ideas---
1. Find your a restaurant of your choice and get the latest data.
2. See if there is a relationship between the RISK category and the SCORE_INSPECTION
3. See if there is a relationship between the SEAT_CAP and the SCORE_INSPECTION
4. Find out which VIOLATIONDESCR is associated with the the highest SCORE_INSPECTION
5. Or whatever you'd like!!!
