Now that we have the data formatted where each row is the latest single inspection record for a restaurant, let's see what we can find out!



```{r, eval=FALSE}
#05- play-with-data

unique(rest_df$TYPE_INSPECTION)

glimpse(rest_df)
# The DATE_INSPECTION FIELD is a factor, but we want it to be a date so we filter on it.

rest_df <- rest_df %>% mutate(DATE_INSP_FORMAT=as.Date(word(as.character(DATE_INSPECTION), 1)))

#let's check to see that now the DATE_INSP_FORMAT field looks like a date and is okay
glimpse(rest_df)

rest_df<-rest_df %>% dplyr::mutate(VIOLATIONPOINTS = replace_na(VIOLATIONPOINTS, 0))

rest_df_filtered <- rest_df %>% filter(TYPE_INSPECTION=='Routine Inspection/Field Review') %>%
  group_by(NAME) %>% 
  filter(DATE_INSP_FORMAT == max(DATE_INSP_FORMAT)) %>% 
  slice(which.max(VIOLATIONPOINTS))

glimpse(rest_df_filtered)

#How do the inspection score vary by city?

# Average and Max Score by City
score_by_city<-rest_df_filtered %>% group_by(CITY) %>% summarize(avg_score= mean(SCORE_INSPECTION),
                                                                 max_score = max(SCORE_INSPECTION),
                                                                 n_rests = n())


score_by_city

# some of the cities have very few restaurants; let's remove those

score_city_sufficient <- score_by_city %>% filter(n_rests>50)

#dplyr works great with ggplot to make plots.  

ggplot(data=score_city_sufficient, aes(x=CITY, y=avg_score)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))+
  ggtitle("Average Restaurant Inspection Score by City") +
  xlab("City") + ylab("Average Restaurant Score")

# does the average score just correlate with number of restaurants?
ggplot(data=score_city_sufficient, aes(x=n_rests, y=avg_score)) +
  geom_point()+ggtitle("Average Restaurant Inspection Score by Number of Restaurants") +
  xlab("Number of Restaurants") + ylab("Average Restaurant Score")

# Seattle throws everything off  
score_city_sufficient_not_too_many <- score_city_sufficient %>% filter(n_rests<100)

  geom_point()+ggtitle("Average Restaurant Inspection Score by Number of Restaurants") +
  xlab("Number of Restaurants") + ylab("Average Restaurant Score")


# What is the info on the restaurant with the worst score by city?

worst_by_city<-rest_df_filtered %>% group_by(CITY) %>% top_n(1, SCORE_INSPECTION)

worst_by_city
# What was the data on the restaurant I liked?

bizzaro_df_filtered <- rest_df_filtered %>% dplyr::filter(str_detect(NAME, 'BIZZARRO'))
bizzaro_df_filtered

############### Exercises ################
1. Find your a restaurant of your choice and get the latest data.
2. Go back to the big dataset and find the worst violation of a restaurant you want.
3. Make a table that shows grouped RISK category and the average and max SCORE_INSPECTION
4. Make a table that shows grouped SEAT_CAP and the average and max SCORE_INSPECTION
5. Find out which VIOLATIONDESCR is associated with the the highest SCORE_INSPECTION
6. Make a barplot that shows the maximum inspection score by city.
